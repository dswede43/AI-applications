# Deep learning projects and applications
![alt text](./AI_brain.png)

My code to create projects and applications that utilize deep learning models.

## BerryBloomID
Image classification app to identify common wildflowers and berries in North America (Canada and USA) using a fine-tuned ViT deep learning model.

## NN from scratch
Using only numpy to impliment forward and back propagation for gradient descent and build a 2-layer neural network
to classify images of numbers from the MNIST dataset.
